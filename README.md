# Jupyter Notebook/Lab jkernel Docker-Image

Originally forked from **martinsaurer/jlang:jkernel** then rewritten such that the Dockerfile has all the components necessary to run in binder

That was done by joebo on joebo/jkernal-docker

copied joebo files to set up a Dockerfile that copies in the addons. Some of those addons may not work in the Binder browser environment
